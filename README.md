# Shadow's Eye - Advanced Information Gathering Tool 

## Introduction

Welcome to the realm of "Shadow's Eye," an advanced information-gathering tool crafted for the discerning cyber warrior. This tool is designed to empower ethical bug hunters and cybersecurity enthusiasts in their quest for uncovering vulnerabilities and strengthening the digital defenses of organizations. With its formidable capabilities, Shadow's Eye will be your trusted companion as you navigate through the shadowy depths of the cyber realm.

## Features

- **DNS Lookup:** Uncover the IP addresses associated with target domains and subdomains, revealing crucial network infrastructure.
- **Subdomain Discovery:** Employ bruteforce techniques using an extensive wordlist to unveil hidden subdomains, expanding your attack surface.
- **Port Scanning:** Identify open ports and vulnerable services, providing insights into potential entry points for further exploitation.
- **Whois Lookup:** Retrieve ownership information, registration details, and associated domains, aiding in target profiling.
- **Social Media Scan:** Discover social media profiles and accounts linked to the target, exposing potential vectors for social engineering.
- **Password Leak Check:** Integrate with password breach databases to identify leaked credentials associated with the target domain, enhancing your social engineering arsenal.
- **Reporting and Visualization:** Generate comprehensive HTML reports with detailed findings, and visualize target network architecture using interactive graphs.

## Usage

To unleash the power of Shadow's Eye, simply clone the repository and follow the instructions below:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `shadowseye.py` script.
3. Run the tool using the command: `python shadowseye.py <target_domain> --wordlist <wordlist_file> --ports <start-end>`.
   - `<target_domain>` should be replaced with the domain you wish to target.
   - `<wordlist_file>` is the path to your wordlist file for subdomain discovery.
   - `<start-end>` specifies the port range for scanning (e.g., `1-1000`).

## Future Enhancements

Shadow's Eye is an ever-evolving project, and future updates will bring even more advanced features to your arsenal:

- **Enhanced Subdomain Discovery:** Integration with additional data sources, such as certificate transparency logs and historical DNS records, to uncover even the most elusive subdomains.
- **API Integration:** Leverage APIs from popular services like VirusTotal and URLScan to enrich your information gathering with threat intelligence and URL analysis.
- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Incorporate vulnerability scanning capabilities to identify known vulnerabilities associated with the target's technologies, providing actionable insights for penetration testing.
- **Machine Learning:** Employ machine learning techniques to analyze target profiles and predict potential attack vectors, elevating your reconnaissance to the next level.
- **Social Engineering Toolkit:** Develop a social engineering module that integrates with your information gathering, providing tailored phishing templates and strategies based on the target's digital footprint.
- **Dark Web Monitoring:** Scour the dark web for mentions of your target, including leaked credentials and sensitive data, to proactively safeguard against potential threats.
